# Learning, Inspiration, aNd Exploration.  
This repository includes codes that:
1. are lab codes I wrote when taking online courses or reading books;
2. trying to reproduce something I'm interested in;
3. I wrote when I got some inpiration and want to create something new but tiny(for now);
4. ...

So this repository will actually be a set of many different projects stored in different directories. I'll create a branch for every single project when I work on it and I'll merge it into the master branch when I'm sure that everything's ok on that branch some time later.

Obviously, for most of the time, this repo is for personal use only, but it welcomes browsing,comments and suggestions(through issues). It would be great if this repo could give hints to people who are working on some subjects it containes, on the other hand, your suggestions are most likely to be helpful for improving my codes and my skills, I'd appretiate for that.

By the way, if a project in this repo works really well and becomes very much complete, practical and independent, I may consider to establish a new repository based on that project and remove the original directory inside this repo(I may not delete it right after I establish the new repo because I have to make sure that the git-history will never be used again). I'll publish those projects in this README file in real-time.

So, have fun!
